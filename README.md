# ETL Process With ShellScript

Here we have the ETL process of data movies of site http://books.toscrape.com. 

Before to start the extraction, the code do some test in order to check if the dependencies are installed, if weren't, the dependencies will be solved. 

This project aims to scrap the data movies and to record them in the structed file. Only two categories of movies were extracted.

For the next version of code, I'm going to extract the pictures of movies and catch more information of each movie.

The content of this extraction will be used in other projects.
